        <li>Company: Hindalco Industries<br>Designation: Intern<br>Role: Web Developer<br>Duration: Dec 2021 - Feb 2022(3 months)<br>Description: This was a 3 months internship in Hindalco Industries Ltd. Most of the work revolved around creating
            visually appealing pages for a website for the company. I
            was allotted as a front-end developer and learned HTML andCSS. We usually collaborated with other interns who workedas content writers and decided how we could place the
            content in an appealing manner. After learning from there I
            personally tried to implement the same in some projects. I
            created a cv using html.
